### 2026-06-13 — Snapshot relay persistent disk deferred
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Sprint 4 optional task considered adding a Starter+ persistent disk for `snapshot_server` so `/tmp/qualified_public_snapshot.json` survives redeploys.
- **Decision:** Keep free-tier ephemeral store; worker reposts snapshot after each scan; `/relay-health` confirms ingest.
- **Alternatives considered:** Starter+ disk (~$0.25/GB/mo); GitHub Pages-only snapshot without relay.
- **Consequences:** Brief empty dashboard window after relay redeploy until next worker POST; acceptable for current ops.
